/*
 * The goal of this program is to compute the total amount of paid and unpaid 
 * orders for each buyer.
 *
 * Each order is associated to a buyer identifier and has a price.
 *
 * The first implementation (inefficient) of this program relies on a data 
 * structure that packed together buyer identifier, the price of the order and 
 * a boolean flag that is true if the order is paid.
 *
 * This is inefficient for different reasons.
 *
 * The first is the encoding of the boolean flag into the data structure.
 *
 * This is not efficient since it moves the `conditional branch` lower in the 
 * loop that computes the sum of the price.
 *
 * This means that at every loop iteration the program needs to test a 
 * condition and branch.
 *
 * Also consider that the flag is stored as a 1 byte value but only 1 bit 
 * could be used to encode the value true or false.
 *
 * This is already a `smell` of an unoptimal approach.
 *
 * The second inefficiency came from the fact that the buyer identifier is 
 * stored together with the order.
 *
 * The total sum of the orders needs the price, not the buyer's identifier.
 *
 * This is inefficient because it `pollutes` the cache lines with UNNECESSARY 
 * DATA.
 *
 * Even worst when the data structure contains the boolean flag.
 *
 * A better approach should deal with both SPATIAL & TEMPORAL LOCALITY of the 
 * data.
 *
 * To understand how to reorganize the data structure it's important to start 
 * from the question:
 *
 *		`what has to be computed by this program?`
 *
 * To maximize SPATIAL LOCALITY the goal is to pack together data that will be 
 * processed together sequentially.
 *
 * To maximize TEMPORAL LOCALITY the goal is to define a small set of 
 * instructions that can be executed many times sequentially.
 *
 * Since the goal of the program is to compute the total amount of paid and 
 * unpaid orders it is ideal to split the two into different data structures 
 * and associate each of them to the buyer's identifier.
 *
 * This approach ensures both SPATIAL LOCALITY by removing the UNNECESSARY 
 * buyer identifier from the data structure and avoid to polluting the cache 
 * line.
 *
 * Also, it provides a better TEMPORAL LOCALITY since the computation can be 
 * expressed in terms of small number of instructions repeated many times.
 *
 * This solution also avoids to test whether the order is paid or not at every 
 * loop iteration.
 *
 * To recap:
 *
 * 1. pushed out of the loop the `conditional branch` by splitting orders into 
 *    two data structures;
 * 2. move at a higher level of abstraction the KEYWORD used to identify a 
 *    single item of interest (in this example is the buyer identifier).
